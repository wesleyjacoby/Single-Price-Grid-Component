## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I still find myself trying to get comfortable with CSS Grid, especially when it comes to `grid-template-areas` and `grid-area` and the need to explicidly declare the columns and rows.

### Continued development

I will continue to try do more challenges that use CSS Grid so as to get more comfortable with it.
